        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          An interactive science museum called the Community of Oslo Science
          Museum is opening. Its core target audience is primary and middle
          school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum
          wants a website that is informative and appealing. The website should
          be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the
          museum itself.
        </p>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment we used the WordPress REST API to manage the
          products for the website deployed on Netlify. Instead of having the
          products hardcoded into the HTML, we used JavaScript to fetch the list
          of WordPress products and display them on the site.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Designed a prototype of the site with Adobe XD</li>
          <li>Tested it with users and built the site</li>
          <li>
            Created an installation of WordPress on the web host and set it to
            be headless so that the front-end generated by WordPress is hidden
            from the public.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using JavaScript, fetched the data from the WordPress REST API and
            added it to the website in the relevant sections of the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using query string parameters allowed the user to click on an
            individual item in the list and took them to see that event, with
            the specific data for that event on the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Took a design we did at the beginning of the course and applied the
            skills we had learnt to make it mobile responsive and test the site
            to make sure load speeds were as efficient as possible.
          </li>

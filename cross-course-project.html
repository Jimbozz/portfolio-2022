          <h3>What Was Changed</h3>
          <p>Improved image size and load speed.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Made unique title for product specific pages.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Went through CSS and HTML to remove any unused/unnecessary code.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Added a max-width for all text.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Gave all link tags titles.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Made sort by price low-high filter work.</p>

          <p>Changed card layout from flex to grid.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>changed the contrast of links and buttons.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How I Changed It</h3>
          <p>I reduced the file sizes after testing on lighthouse which images were slowing the site down and where improvements could be made. I also used a wordpress plugin after new images were uploaded to increase load speed.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>When fetching the product data from wordpress I also made sure to store the product name in the title of the page.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Went through all files and removed code as well as adjusting the tab space from 4 to 2.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>I set the max-width for the container surrounding the text.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Had to find each link tag and give it a unique title for that specific link.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Before I just had the checkbox there. Now I added javascript using the reverse method to make it sort the results with price low-high.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>By setting it from display flex to grid and using auto-fit min-max to make the cards fit the space provided.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Tested it with firefox dev tools and chrome to find out which specific colours and backgrounds were having contrast issues and fixed them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Why I Did It That Way</h3>
          <p>I used the plugin as it was easier than going through all the content again and re-uploading it. I also reduced the file size as much as possible so that the site experience would be improved and users did not have to wait for the site to load.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>This was the easiest way to grab the title of the page as I was creating each page dynamically with javascript.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>This was done to reduce the amount of code as well as making it easier for other people who will look at the code in the future.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>If a container contained multiple text elements then they would all have a max-width if I set it on the container.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>I did this to make it more accessible for screen readers and describes the purpose of that link.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>This seemed like the most simple way to get it to work although maybe not the best way of going about it but I made do with the time I had.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>I felt like for things like product cards or card layouts in general grid worked more neatly when looking at a lot of cards and made the experience better for the user as well as for someone working with code.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>By fixing the contrast issue I could make the site more accessible for users and people with colour blindness.</p>

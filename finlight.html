        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          My first job when living in London was with a company called Finlight.
          They were a small startup with a team of about 8 who were based in
          both London and Brussels. Their aim was to create a platform where
          family offices and private allocators could build a high quality VC
          portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was brought on to the team to help them with marketing and branding
          but soon shifted into helping them improve their design of their
          platform. As it was a small company I naturally had to help with many
          things which I did not specialize in such as the design of a platform
          and collecting research from current users of the platform. This is
          how I found my love for UI design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my time there I was lucky enough to design the platform and
          work closely with developers and participate in various sprints where
          we implemented small upgrades to the platform from informed research.
        </p>

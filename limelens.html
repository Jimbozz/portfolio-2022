        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          We created and designed a smartphone lens attachment for photography
          enthusiasts to use on major smartphone brands. The first step was the
          market research to see what we were up against and to see if anyone
          had noticed the gap which we had. The gap was that nobody was making a
          lens system which could be removed and attached to multiple devices.
          Once we had done some our research the sketching of products began and
          connecting with engineers for advice. The next choice we made was to
          fly to China (Shenzhen) to find a manufacturer who we felt comfortable
          working with and who could help us with the advice on the best
          materials and methods to use to reduce the cost. We had also created a
          partnership with a distributor in the US who could distribute to the
          US, Canada and parts of Europe. During this phase we were also coming
          up with concepts for the brand and designing websites, packaging,
          marketing materials etc. After about 6 months of development we were
          ready to get our online store up and running and start selling our
          first product.
        </p>
        <h2>Version One</h2>
        <p>
          We noticed the gap in the market for lens attachments with higher
          quality glass and universality for smartphones and we jumped at the
          opportunity. We developed the first version as a set of 3 lenses:
          Fisheye and a 2-in-1 Macro/Wide lens.

        <h2>Version Two</h2>
        <p>
          When we started we had one goal in mind: To create the most universal
          phone attachment on the market. The response was great on the first
          version which then led us to form a relationship with an engineering
          firm who would help us create a second version of lenses and lens
          mounts, with even more universality.

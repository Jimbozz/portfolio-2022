        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          We had to create an e-commerce website that had both customer-facing
          and admin sections. Both sections were to be responsive and the
          website would be populated by a Strapi API.
        </p>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>
          We could can choose the theme of the website. It should follow the
          site architecture described below. Designed the website and logo using
          Adobe XD and illustrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart
          pages.
        </p>
        <p>Built the admin pages to create, update and delete products.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>The home page included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A hero banner with an image that was uploaded to Strapi.</li>
          <li>
            A list of featured products. When a product is marked as 'featured'
            on Strapi it was to be displayed on the homepage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Products page</h3>
        <p>The products page included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A list of all products added to Strapi. Each product displayed its
            title, price and image. The product linked to its products detail
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            A search text box. When searching (filtering), only the products
            that include the searched text in their title or description were
            listed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Product details page</h3>
        <p>
          This page is reached by a user clicking on a product on the product
          list page. The product details page must include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Description</li>
          <li>Image</li>
          <li>Price</li>
          <li>
            An add to cart button. This toggled the product in and out of a cart
            array stored in local storage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cart/Basket page</h3>
        <p>
          The cart/basket page displays a list of all products added to the
          cart. Next load the items that have been added to local storage and
          display them on the page. If the cart was empty a message was
          displayed indicating this.
        </p>
        <p>Each product in the cart must display:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Price</li>
          <li>A link to the product view page</li>
          <li>Image</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After the list of products, the total price of all the products in the
          cart was to be displayed.
        </p>
        <h2>Admin section</h2>
        <p>
          The admin section (apart from the log in form) must only be accessible
          to logged in admin users and the following features were to be
          included.
        </p>
        <h3>Login/logout</h3>
        <p>
          Created an admin login form that allowed administrator users to login.
          Used local storage to keep the user logged in.
        </p>
        <p>
          When logged in, a logout button must be displayed in the layout that
          logs the user out. Logging out should not clear the cart.
        </p>
        <h3>Add/edit products</h3>
        <p>
          Created form(s) that allowed products to be added and edited. The form
          allowed the user to toggle whether a product is featured or not.
        </p>
        <h3>Product images</h3>
        <p>For adding/editing product images I used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A file upload field to upload images to Strapi</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Allowed products to be deleted. Before a product is deleted I had to
          display a confirmation dialog. The product should only be deleted if
          the user confirms.
